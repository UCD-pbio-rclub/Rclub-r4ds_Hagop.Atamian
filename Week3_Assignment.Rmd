#PLot the displ on the x-axis and hwy on the y-axis
```{r}
#install.packages("ggplot")
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mpg.data) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```
#3.2.4 Exercises
```{r}
#Excercise 1
ggplot(data = mpg)
#you see nothing. Just empty graph

#Excercise 2
#How many rows are in mtcars? How many columns?
dim(mtcars)
#[1] 32 rows and 11 columns
```

```{r}
#Excercise 3
#What does the drv variable describe? Read the help for ?mpg to find out
?mpg
#It shows the wheel drive
#f = front-wheel drive, r = rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd
```

```{r}
#Excercise 4
#Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cyl, y =hwy))
```

```{r}
#Excercise 5:
#What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv. Why is the plot not useful?
ggplot(date = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = class, y = drv))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```

#3.3.1 Exercises
```{r}
# 1) Whatâ€™s gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
#because it is in the aes() function. For manual assignment of colors the assignment should be its own function
ggplot(data =mpg) +
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")
```

```{r}
# 2) Which variables in mpg are categorical? Which variables are continuous? (Hint: type ?mpg to read the documentation for the dataset). How can you see this information when you run mpg?
#colnames(mpg)
summary(mpg)
```

```{r}
# 3) Map a continuous variable to color, size, and shape. How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous variables?
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = year, color = hwy))
#how do they behave differently??Ask in the class
```

```{r}
# 4) What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = hwy))
# I think it shows the values. Nothing wrong with it. 
```

```{r}
# 5) What does the stroke aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? (Hint: use ?geom_point)
?geom_point
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cyl, stroke = 2))
#stroke assigns the width of the border of the shape
```

```{r}
# 4)What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like aes(colour = displ < 5)?
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cyl, y = hwy, color = displ < 5))
#returns a TRUE or FALSE value
```

# 3.5 Facets

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 1)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
```

#3.5.1 Exercises

```{r}
# 1)What happens if you facet on a continuous variable?
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = cyl)) +
  facet_wrap(~ hwy)
#Becomes too complicated since it makes a figure for each data
```

```{r}
# 2) What do the empty cells in plot with facet_grid(drv ~ cyl) mean? How do they relate to this plot?
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl))
#Don't know the answer
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ cyl)
```
